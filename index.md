        <p>
        <b>Welcome!</b> I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology where I work in the AMBER Lab with Professor Aaron Ames. Prior to joining Caltech, I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University working in the Boston University Robotics Lab with Professor Calin Belta and, prior to that, earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Florida. As a graduate student, I was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and won Best Dissertation in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b> I am starting as a tenure-track Assistant Professor </b> in the <a href="https://ece.ncsu.edu/"> Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University </a> this fall and am <b>currently recruiting Ph.D. students for Spring 2026 and Fall 2026.</b> If you are interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in the general areas of control theory, robotics, and autonomy, please check out <a href="/students/"> my prospective students page.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        My research broadly focuses on control systems with applications in robotics and autonomy. I'm particularly interested in getting highly dynamic systems (e.g., walking robotics, drones, aircraft) to complete complex tasks. My current research focuses on safety-critical control architectures with the goal of certifying system-level properties of such systems based on properties of their individual components (e.g., controllers, motion planners, state estimators). I'm also interested in unifying classical learning-based control approaches, such as adaptive control, with more modern machine learning-based techniques to endow autonomous systems with adaptive capabilities.
